# LeetCode-Python-Practice
This repository serves as a coding journal and a sandbox for my daily algorithmic practice.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3
- Concepts: Data Structures & Algorithms

## Study Methodology: Spaced Repetition

- **Implementation**: Focus on solving the problem and passing test cases.
- **Retrospection**: Revisit the solution a few days later to write **Takeaways**, analyze complexity, and optimize code.
