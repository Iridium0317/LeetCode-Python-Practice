# LeetCode Python Practice

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python3-blue)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success)

This repository serves as a coding journal and a sandbox for my daily algorithmic practice, random picks, and contest problems.

> **Note**: This is a supplementary repo for experimental solutions. My structured study plans (e.g., LeetCode 75) are maintained in a separate repository.

## Tech Stack & Focus
- **Language**: Python 3 (Transitioning from C++/C)
- **Focus**: Pythonic implementation, Standard Library mastery, and Code Readability.
- **Tools**: VS Code with LeetCode extension.

## Study Methodology: Spaced Repetition

My workflow involves two stages:

1.  **Implementation (Phase 1)**: 
    - Focus on solving the problem and passing test cases.
    - Initial commit with a working solution.
    
2.  **Retrospection (Phase 2)**: 
    - Revisit the solution after a few days.
    - Write Takeaways and complexity analysis in the file's docstrings.
    - Refactor code to be more "Pythonic" or optimize time/space complexity.

## Progress Tracker (Notable Problems)
