# 263. 丑数 – Ugly Number

**Problem**  
An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *is an **ugly number***.

**Example**

```text
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

**Constraints:**
*   -231 <= n <= 231 - 1
